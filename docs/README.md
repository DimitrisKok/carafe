# These Are Not The Droids You're Looking For

These built packages are tracked and intended to be released as official package examples.

We use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host released packages, and we follow the GitHub Pages convention of using `/docs` as the web root for GitHub Pages.

If you're a package developer looking for the webpack output in the local Docker web root, take a look in  `/public` after you run webpack. The packages in there are built on demand so you can preview your work, and are not tracked.
