# Carafe Package Development Preview

Look here in `/public` after you run webpack in development mode. The packages in here are built so you can preview your work. Files here are not tracked. If you intend to PR a package as an official Carafe package, you will need to do a release build, so that it will get output into `/docs` and tracked.
